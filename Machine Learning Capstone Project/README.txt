be applying several machine learning methods on both data sets.
The First data set was originally used in a research done at the University of Minho, Portugal (Cortez and Silva, 2008).
The second data set was originally used in research made at the University of Jordan.
for first dataset i run code in "UCI-data-proj.ipynb"
and for second dataset i run code in "Edu-Data-proj.ipynb"
I attached the following files:
